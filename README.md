How to create maps of urban growth or building heights with a stained glass effect
To create this type of maps, the buildings layer is used, whose source of data is the Cadastre (https://www.sedecatastro.gob.es/).
To achieve the stained glass effect, we have to make the following settings
  Change the background of our project to black.
  Create a buffer with a radius of 2.5 km.
  Use a colour ramp in which the height of the buildings is displayed in ranges.
